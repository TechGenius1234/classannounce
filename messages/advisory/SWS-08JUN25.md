### What: A period of elevated temperatures is expected.

### When: Continuing into early next week.

### Where: The southwestern interior of BC and the western part of the Kootenay District.

#### Remarks: A ridge of high pressure is bringing high temperatures to the region. Temperatures will be warming with the highs expected to be in the low to mid 30's with overnight lows in the mid teens. High temperatures will persist into early next week. 

#### Early season heat can be significant due to the lack of acclimatization to elevated temperatures.

#### Keep your house cool. Block the sun by closing curtains or blinds. Watch for the effects of heat illness: heavy sweating, rash, cramps, fainting, high body temperature and the worsening of some health conditions. Fans alone cannot effectively lower core body temperature, especially for older adults. Use fans to pull in cooler air from outdoors, but if you or someone you care for is experiencing symptoms of heat illness, find a cooler space.

#### Please continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to BCstorm@ec.gc.ca or post reports on X using #BCStorm.
